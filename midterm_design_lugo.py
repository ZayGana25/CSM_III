# Week 4 Assignment Pseudo Code

Start

# Initialize lists to store heights, weights, and BMIs
# Initialize variables to count underweight, normal weight, and overweight individuals

# FOR each individual from 1 to 6:
    # Prompt for input of height in inches
    # Prompt for input of weight in pounds
    
    # Convert height and weight to the appropriate data types
    
    # Calculate BMI using the formula (weight / height^2) * 703
    
    # Store the calculated BMI in the BMIs list
    
    # IF BMI < 18.5:
        # Increment underweight count
    # ELSE IF BMI is between 18.5 and 24.9:
        # Increment normal weight count
    # ELSE:
        # Increment overweight count

# FOR each individual:
    # Output the corresponding BMI value

# Output the total number of individuals in each category (underweight, normal, overweight)
